AI Instruction:
Generate a detailed branching narrative structure for a 'Choose Your Own Adventure' story. Represent this structure as a hierarchical outline.
Each node in the structure represents a distinct segment or 'page' of the story. For each node, provide:
Node ID: A unique identifier (e.g., page_1, forest_path_A, city_square_decision).
Brief Title: A short descriptive title for the segment (e.g., The Journey Begins, Fork in the Path, Encounter in the Alley).
Segment Summary: A 1-3 sentence summary of the key events or description of the scene for this segment.
Decision(s) and Outcomes: If this segment requires a reader decision, clearly list the options available to the reader. For each option, specify the Node ID of the next segment the reader will go to if they choose that option. If a segment is an ending, state 'Ending' and briefly describe the outcome.

Ensure the structure includes:
A clear starting node (e.g., start_page).
Multiple decision points that lead to different paths.
At least the specified number of distinct endings.
Paths that vary in length and potential outcomes.
Logical connections between segments based on decisions.

Using the narrative structure and the initial story inputs, write the full narrative content for each segment (Node ID) in the structure.
For each Node ID from the structure:
Write the story segment's narrative content. This should be a paragraph or more, describing the scene, actions, dialogue, and atmosphere based on the Segment Summary.
At the end of the segment, clearly present the decision options to the reader, exactly as outlined in the structure. Phrase the options naturally within the narrative or clearly list them (e.g., 'Do you choose to [Option A]? Go to page [Node ID]. Or do you [Option B]? Go to page [Node ID].'). Use the Node IDs as the 'page numbers' the reader goes to.
Ensure the writing style matches the user's request.
Maintain consistency with the protagonist, supporting characters, setting, and items defined in the initial inputs.
If a segment is an 'Ending' node, write a concluding paragraph describing the final outcome.
Present the output with each segment clearly labeled by its Node ID.
